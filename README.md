Developing IOT projects
What is Arduino?

• “Arduino is an open-source physical computing platform
based on a simple i/o board and a development
environment that implements the Processing / Wiring
language. Arduino can be used to develop stand-alone
interactive objects or can be connected to software on
your computer.“

##Why Arduino?

• It is Open Source, both in terms of Hardware and
Software.
• It is cheap(1300र), the hardware can be built from
components or a prefab board can be purchased for
approx 900र.
• It can communicate with a computer via serial
connection over USB.
• It can be powered from USB or standalone DC power.

##How to get started

• You’ll need a board of course, along with the USB cable
and DC power supplies.
• Read about, understand what you are working with and
download the IDE: http://www.arduino.cc
• Mac, Windows and Penguin friendly versions available
• Then you are ready to plug it in!
